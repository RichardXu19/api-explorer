<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The placement service allows vRealize Automation (vRA) to use an external metrics provider
such as vRealize Operations Manager (vROps) to obtain placement recommendations for machine
resources within deployments.</p>

<p>The public placement service REST API allows callers to manage their tenant-level placement
policy, which tells vRA whether it should obtain placement recommendations from the external
metrics provider or use its own placement algorithms.</p>
